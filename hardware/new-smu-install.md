The system consists of one or more subracks, each holding up to 8 SMU board, which have 4 channels each, for a total of 32 channels per subrack. In addition a pair of 8-channel sensors adapter board can be inserted to access the sensor channels (see [[Sensor]]).

SMU boards are plug and play. In case of a new board or a replacement, they can simply be swapped without any additional work. The order of the SMU boards is counted from right to left. The first and fifth slot of each subrack is reserved for the sensor adapter boards.
