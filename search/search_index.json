The traces connect to a custom connector, which in turn connects through a cable back to the source measure units. Devices on a sample holder are usually back-contacted. This simplifies the design of the sample holder and avoids having the contact probes block the incident light. Devices are pressed onto the spring-loaded contacts using a metal mask with openings for the incident light. The mask can be fixed in place using screws or magnets depending on the design.</p>      Example of a sample holder for 32 devices distributed across 4 substrates.      On the bottom left, temperature, humidity, and luminosity sensors can be found.    <p>The figure above shows an example of a sample holder for 32 devices in a small area. Since the devices are always grouped together in the same order, smaller and more flexible Samtec\u00ae cables are used instead of eight bulky DB25 connectors. These cables also carry the signals used to measure the environmental sensors present on the sample holder.</p> <p>Testing each sample holder is not reliable when using lab-level devices, since failing to measure a signal may be due to a failing device rather than a fault in the sample holder. For each type of sample holder, a custom PCB with the same layout as the solar cells is therefore made. The solar cells are substituted with resistors to reliably test the entire connection chain.</p>"},{"location":"hardware/smu-introduction/","title":"Source Measure Unit (SMU) Introduction","text":"<p>Each ARKEO SMU board contains four independent source-measure channels, brought out through a standardized DB25 connector.

In the standard configuration, the low range supports measurements up to approximately 18 mA, while the high range extends to around 250 mA. These values are chosen to cover both small-area (&lt; 1 cm\u00b2) and large-area (&gt; 1 cm\u00b2) solar cells without requiring hardware changes.</p> <p>For very low-current applications, such as detecting nA-level leakage or measuring early-stage materials, the system can be customized by modifying the shunt resistor or adding a low-noise current amplifier.

Two wires carry the sourced current (Force+ and Force\u2013), while the second pair (Sense+ and Sense\u2013) measures the voltage directly across the device terminals. Because the sense wires carry negligible current, their measured voltage does not include any cable or contact resistance.</p> <p></p> <p>This configuration is particularly important for low-voltage devices, low-resistance samples, or measurements requiring high precision.

Each measurement begins with a JV scan, which provides the initial device parameters and an estimate of the maximum power point. This initial scan ensures that the system has a reliable starting point before entering tracking mode.</p> <p>Once the JV scan is complete, the system moves the device voltage toward the estimated MPP at the defined JV scan rate. If tracking is enabled, the system then applies a control algorithm that keeps the device at the chosen operating point. Depending on the configuration, this operating point may correspond to the maximum power point, open-circuit voltage, short-circuit current, or a user-defined voltage or current.</p> <p></p> <p>Although the SMU hardware does not support galvanostatic operation, the potentiostatic behavior is sufficient for most algorithms. All algorithms except open-circuit voltage rely on a proportional adjustment operation (PAO) to maintain the desired setpoint. In open-circuit mode, the SMU simply enters a high-impedance state, causing the device to float naturally to Voc.</p> <p>When operating at a fixed voltage, it is important to consider that the SMU regulates the source voltage rather than the voltage directly at the device terminals. Under load, a small voltage drop can occur across the output stage, creating a difference between the set voltage and the voltage actually applied to the device. Tracking can be used to compensate for this offset when maintaining a fixed-voltage operating condition.</p> <p>Warning</p> <p>This limitation is especially relevant during JV scans. The set voltage may not correspond exactly to the actual device voltage, which can cause the scan to miss the current axis crossing if it starts at 0 V. To avoid this, JV scans start at -0.2 V by default, ensuring that the voltage sweep always crosses the J=0 axis. Another approach is to begin the scan in reverse. At Voc the current is zero, so no voltage drop occurs, and the scan naturally moves toward the required crossing point.</p> <p>At regular intervals, the system performs an additional JV scan. These periodic scans serve two purposes. First, they provide updated JV parameters\u2014such as efficiency, fill factor, Voc, and Jsc\u2014allowing users to follow the evolution of device performance over time. This offers better insight into degradation behavior than monitoring MPP alone. Second, periodic scans confirm that the MPP being tracked remains the true global maximum and has not shifted due to device changes during the measurement period.</p> <p>The combination of JV initialization, continuous tracking, and periodic full scans enables ARKEO to characterize device performance accurately while maintaining stable long-term operation.</p>"},{"location":"software/measurement/starting-a-measurement/","title":"Starting a Measurement","text":""},{"location":"software/measurement/starting-a-measurement/#starting-a-measurement","title":"Starting a measurement","text":"<p>Before starting any measurement, ensure that your device are properly connected (see connecting device).

Starting from an initial V_MPP obtained from the JV, the device is slightly positively and negatively perturbed (\u0394V) with respect to V_MPP. This results in 3 points: V_MPP-\u0394V, V_MPP, V_MPP+\u0394V. For each point, the device power recorded, and the voltage associated with the maximum power is set as the new V_MPP. The algorithm is then repeated.</p> Current spikes <p>Jumps in voltage, especially when far from the MPP where the current changes more with changes in voltages, can cause problems in the measurement due to the capacitive effects of many photovoltaic devices. A JV scan stops either at Jsc (when measuring in reverse direction) or at Voc (when measuring in forward direction). A jump in voltage from this point to MPP causes a large current spike as the capacitive effect wears off.
