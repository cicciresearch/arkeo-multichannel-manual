Each Eurocard board contains 4 independent source meter unit (SMU) modules that can be accessed using a standardized DB25 connector. Each SMU measures and supplies voltage and current to the device. The voltage measurement contact points are connected, though a buffer, directly to the high-speed digitizer, which has a programmable range of \u00b110 V. Current flows through a current sensing resistance and the voltage drop is measured by the digitizer.</p> <p>Each SMU has 2 current sensing resistors of 562 \u03a9 and 5 \u03a9. As the digitizer can measure and supply a maximum of 10V, these resistors allow for a maximum current of 18.8 mA and 2 A to flow. 2 A is too much for the small devices that the system is designed for, so it is limited to 250 mA to reduce cost and complexity of the SMUs.</p> <p>The digitizer does not have infinite precision and at low currents, the signal-to-noise ratio starts to increase. The Low current range with the higher current sensing resistor improves the signal-to-noise ratio, but it may not be enough for currents less than ~1 \u00b5A. In that case, the current sensing resistor may be replaced by a higher resistance of, for example, 5 k\u03a9 or 50 k\u03a9 depending on the expected current of the devices. In addition, the SMUs have a current amplifier installed, which boosts the current by a factor of 10, 100 or 1000 for even more precision at the cost of maximum current to be measured.</p> <p>To reduce load on both the devices and the SMUs, each SMU has an internal relay to switch the current to a high impedance (100 k\u03a9) state, blocking current flow. In this state, the connected devices may be considered in open-circuit voltage. This is useful both for checking whether the device is well connected as well as being able to measure the open-circuit voltage over time.</p>"},{"location":"smu-introduction/#db25-pinout","title":"DB25 Pinout","text":"<p>Each DB25 connector connects to 4 SMUs.
