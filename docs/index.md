# Introduction
The Arkeo multichannel system consists of multiple independent SMUs in parallel. Each device under test is connected to its own dedicated source meter unit that (depending on the model) can drive its device up to ±10 V, and source/sink currents up to ±250 mA. Source meter units are plug-and-play boards in the Eurocard format. They connect to a custom backplane which provides power and communication with the computer.
