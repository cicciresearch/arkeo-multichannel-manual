When using a [sample holder](../hardware/sample-holders.md), it can become confusing which devices are connected to which channels. Instead of using the [regular settings](settings.md) window, it is recommended to use the sample holder UI. With this graphical user interface, you can easily select the correct devices without having to worry about associating the correct channel

![holder-ui](../assets/img/sample-holder-tool.png)

The holder ui gives a schemetic representation of the physical setup. You can select any number of channels. Changing any setting on the right side will apply them to all selected channels. Refer to [Settings](settings.md) for more details.

If multiple chambers are present, select them from the top table. It is currently not possible to select channel from multiple chambers at the same time.
