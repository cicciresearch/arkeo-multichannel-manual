# ARKEO Software Overview

The ARKEO software manages all measurement tasks, device configurations, data acquisition, and visualization across the multichannel system. It is designed for parallel operation, allowing multiple users to configure and monitor their own channels independently while sharing the same hardware platform. This section provides an overview of the software modules and directs you to detailed guides for each part of the system.

The software supports JV scans, maximum power point tracking, day-night cycling, environmental sensing, and automated long-duration stability experiments. Measurement data is stored per user and per channel to keep datasets organized during multi-user operation.

## How the Software Fits Into the ARKEO System

The software coordinates all measurement activities and interacts directly with the SMU hardware, environmental sensors, and optional auxiliary modules such as light soakers or chambers. It performs JV scans, controls tracking algorithms, updates visual displays, logs data to disk, and monitors all channels in real time. Each channel operates independently, allowing many devices to be measured simultaneously without affecting one another.

## Before You Begin

If you are new to the ARKEO platform, we recommend starting with the following pages:

1. **[Starting a Measurement](measurement/starting-a-measurement.md)** - how to configure channels and run your first JV.
2. **[JV Scan](measurement/jv-scan.md)** - understanding how JV curves are measured and how device parameters are extracted.
3. **[Tracking](measurement/tracking.md)** - performing maximum power point tracking and stability measurements.
4. **[Data Files](data/index.md)** - understanding how ARKEO stores measurement results and how to interpret them.
5. **[Measurement Process](measurement/measurement-process.md)** - how ARKEO performs JV initialization, MPPT control, and periodic JV scans during long-term operation.

These topics provide the foundation for all other software components.
