Sample holders can be placed inside dedicated environmental chambers. All chambers have a temperature controlled base (air or liquid cooled). They can be sealed with a glass cover to allow for inert environments such as N2. Inlet and outlet valves are present to allow fluxing of gasses (up to 1.4 bar).
